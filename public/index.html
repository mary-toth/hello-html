    <p><h1>Veganism</h1></p>
  
    <p>
     <div>Something I have been very passionate about for the past eight years is
      animal rights/veganism. I am a believer that animals deserve autonomy over
      their lives; rather than being commodities for humans, they should be free
      to live out their lives in the most natural ways possible.</div>
    </p>
    <p><h1>Why?</h1></p>
    
      <div> 
        <p>I've long known that the meat and dairy industry is not only harmful to
      animals, but also to the earth and human health. Meat and dairy products
      are the top source of saturated fat in the typical American’s diet- these
      fats contribute to:

        <ul>
        <li>heart disease</li>
        <li>cancer</li>
        <li>diabetes</li> 
        <li>and Alzheimer's disease. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </p>
     <p><h1>The Future</h1></p> 
    
    <div> 
      <p>I’m passionate about a <b>green</b> future for us all! One of my biggest dreams is for
      everyone to switch to a plant-based diet to benefit the animals, earth,
      and themselves. This is definitely a lofty goal, but I think society is
      heading in this direction, albeit slowly. With most restaurants serving
      plant-based alternatives, coffee shops supplying dairy-free milk, and
      grocery stores full of meat and cheese alternatives, it is easier than
      ever to make the switch to a plant-based diet, and I’m so excited to see
      what else the future holds.
